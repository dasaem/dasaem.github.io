  <p>Each tile is worth its face value (the number shown on the tile). In order to make an initial meld, each player
must place tiles on the table in one or more sets that total at least 30 points. These points must come from
the tiles on each player’s rack; for their initial meld, players may not use tiles already played on the table.
A joker used in the initial meld scores the value of the tile it represents. When players cannot play any tiles
from their racks, or purposely choose not to, they must draw a tile from the pool. After they draw, their turn is
over. Play passes to the left (clockwise). On turns after a player has made his/her initial meld, that player can
build onto other sets on the table with tiles from his/her rack. On any turn that a player cannot add onto
another set or play a set from his/her rack, that player picks a tile from the pool and his/her turn ends.
Players cannot lay down a tile they just drew; they must wait until their next turn to play this tile.
Play continues until one player empties his/her rack and calls, “Rummikub!” This ends the game and players
tally their points (see Scoring). If there are no more tiles in the pool but no player has emptied
his/her rack, play continues until no more plays can be made. This ends the game.</p>
