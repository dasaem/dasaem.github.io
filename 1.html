  <p>Place the tiles face down on the table and mix them thoroughly. Each player picks a tile; the player with the
  highest number goes first. Return the tiles to the table and mix them. It is recommended to stack the tiles in
  piles of 7 for ease of playing. Each player takes 14 tiles and places them on his/her rack.

  <p style="margin-top:40px;">The remaining tiles are called the <strong>'pool'</strong> Each round is made up of multiple games.
  The number of playersdetermines the number of games in a round - with four players a round is made up of four games, with three
  players a round is made up of three games, and with two players a round is made up of two games. However,
  the players can determine the numbers of rounds. (Nevertheless - players may have their own 'house rules' )
  When a player plays the last tile on his/her rack a game ends. Players then start over again until they have
  played the number of games/rounds they agreed to play.</p>
