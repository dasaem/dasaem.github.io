  <p>Manipulation is the most exciting part of playing "Rummikub®". Players try to table the greatest amount
of tiles by rearranging or adding to sets which are already on the table. Sets can be manipulated in many
ways as long as at the end of each round only legitimate sets remain and no loose tiles
are left over. A tile is missing from the potential blue run on the rack.
The player takes the blue 4 from the group of four on the table and lays the run:
blue 3,4,5,6. Remove a fourth tile from a group and use it to form a new set:
Add one or more tiles from rack to make new set.
Blue 4,5,6 are on the table. The player
adds a blue 3. The blue 8 is added to the
group of 8’s already on the table.
Add a fourth tile to a set and remove one tile from it, to make another set.
The player adds a blue 11 to the run and
uses the 8’s to form a new group.
Combined split:
The player places a blue 1 from the rack with
the orange 1 from the run and the red 1 from
the group to form a new group.
